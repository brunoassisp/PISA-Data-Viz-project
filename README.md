# PISA-Data-Viz-project (In construction :construction_worker:)
Data Visualization Project from Udacity developed over the PISA dataset

## Summary
PISA is a worldwide study by OECD in member and non-member nations intended to **evaluate educational systems** by measuring 15-year-old students **scholastic performance on _mathematics_, _science_, and _reading_**.

In this **Data Visualization Project**, I'm going to present the **students maths behavior per country** based on PISA-defined variables.

This dataset may not represent the reality, but it can give a sense over students perfomance and behavior.

Besides that, to achieve the final dataset used to build this visualization, an EDA process was realized.

## Design
The design followed a ["martini glass" visualzation](https://www.benchmarkemail.com/blogs/detail/infographics-structure-the-martini-glass) and by using a [**frequency polygon**](http://onlinestatbook.com/2/graphing_distributions/freq_poly.html) it shows how the students behavior varies per country.

By applying different **colors** and **transparency** in the lines, it becomes possible to analyze and compare a Country behavior with the others and understand which is the tendency for every country.

Besides that, a **table** was used to prompt the values highlighted in the current selection.

Mouse events were also covered so the user could interact with the circles (or bubbles) from the chart.

## Feedback
Many feedbacks were taken into account to build the final view. Let's list some of them:
- Create a link between the table and the circles hovering action;
- Adding more transparency to the non-highlighted lines;
- Adding a gap between the y-axis and the first x point;
- Highlighting the highest value in the table;

## Final View
